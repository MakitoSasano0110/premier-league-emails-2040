Date: December 20, 2040

Mikel,

Performance analysis for contract-related bonuses and renewal considerations:

Bonus Payments Triggered (2040 Season):
- Rodriguez: £750,000 (15 goals × £50k per goal)
- Yamamoto: £200,000 (8 goals × £25k per goal - prorated contract)
- Henderson: £350,000 (14 assists × £25k per assist)
- Santos: £120,000 (12 assists × £10k per assist - captain bonus)

Automatic Extension Clauses:
- Thompson: 12 appearances (needs 25 for automatic renewal)
- Chen: 8 first-team appearances (triggers youth contract upgrade)
- Larsson: 35 appearances (triggers one-year extension option)

Performance Concerns:
- Striker Wilson: 22 appearances, 4 goals (below 0.5 goals/game threshold)
- Midfielder Jones: 15 appearances, 2 assists (performance clause not met)

Contract Renegotiation Priorities:
1. Santos (captain, consistent performer)
2. Rodriguez (top scorer, market value increased)
3. Larsson (reliable goalkeeper, clean sheet record)

Revenue impact of bonuses: £1.42 million for 2040 season.

Best regards,
Alex Murphy
Performance Analyst

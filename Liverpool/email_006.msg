Jurgen,

Mid-season performance review focusing on contractual targets:

Goal Bonus Achievements:
- Salah Jr.: 22 goals (£2.2M in bonuses earned)
- Nunez II: 16 goals (£1.6M in bonuses earned)  
- Mane Jr.: 13 goals (£1.3M in bonuses earned)
- Havertz Jr.: 8 goals since joining (£200K earned)

Assist Bonus Achievements:
- Alexander-Arnold III: 14 assists (£700K earned)
- Salah Jr.: 11 assists (£550K earned)
- Mane Jr.: 9 assists (£450K earned)
- Diaz Jr.: 7 assists (£350K earned)

Appearance Thresholds:
- Van Dijk III: 31/35 appearances (on track for full bonus)
- Jones II: 19/25 appearances (needs 6 more for extension)
- Kelleher II: 28/30 appearances (clean sheet bonus active)
- Morton: 8/20 appearances (needs consistent selection)

Performance Concerns:
- Midfielder Elliott: 12 appearances, 1 goal (below target rate)
- Defender Phillips: 15 appearances, high error rate affecting bonus
- Forward Origi Jr.: 6 appearances, 1 goal (limited impact)

Contract Incentive Recommendations:
- Continue rotating Jones to reach appearance threshold
- Utilize Salah Jr. strategically to maximize goal bonuses
- Monitor Van Dijk's minutes to prevent injury before bonus target

Total Bonus Expenditure (Season to Date): £8.7 million
Projected Annual Bonus Cost: £12.4 million
